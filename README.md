# Exposure API
Flask API backend for the Exposure app project to track exposure risks to COVID-19 

## Developing
I'm using python `3.6.8` but any version 3.6+ is probably fine 

From root...

Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```

Start your virtual environment

On windows:
```
venv\Scripts\Activate
```

or Linux:
```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running
```
flask run
```
